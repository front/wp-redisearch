# RediSearch

**IMPORTANT**: The latest version of this plugin supports RediSearch version 2.0 (or higher) which runs on Redis 6.0 (or higher). If you have version prior to 2.0, please use this plugins 0.2.7. 

Redisearch implements a search engine on top of Redis. It has lots of advanced features, like exact phrase matching and numeric filtering for text queries, that are nearly not possible or inefficient with mysql search queries.

Here you find a list of RediSearch features included in the plugin:

**Search**: Instantly find the content youâ€™re looking for. The first time.

**Scoring fields differently**: Give different score to different fields. For example higher score to product name and number than its description.

**Fuzzy Search**: Don't worry about visitors misspelling.

**Autosuggest**: Adds a suggestion string to an auto-complete suggestion dictionary.

**Synonyms**: RediSearch supports synonyms, that is searching for synonyms words defined by the synonym data structure.

### Existing features

* WooCommerce: Index and search through most of existing products meta data.
* Document: Index content of binary files such as pdf, word, excel and powerpoint.
* Synonym: Adding synonym groups is simple. Just add each comma separated group on a new line in synonym settings and done.
* Live search (aka autosuggest): Search as you type regardless of misspelling.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### What is wrong with WordPress native search?

Although mySql is a great database to storing relational data, It acts very poor on search queries and you must forget about some features like fuzzy matching and synonyms.

#### How Redisearch is compared to ElasticSearch?

Yes, ElasticSearch is a great search engine and it has very good performance compared to mySql. But RediSearch has almost 5 to 10 times better performance and also its way easier to create index, sync your data and send query requests.
